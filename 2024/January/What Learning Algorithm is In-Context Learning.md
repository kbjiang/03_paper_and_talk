## What is it about
- What is ICL, how is it related to or different from generic ML learning
- Can LM implement ICL in principle
- Do they do it in practice?

## Details
1. Is ICL "learning"
	1. contradicting hypothesis: invoke vs learning, translation vs made-up rules
## Main takeaways
1. It is "next token regression", but the function to learn is in context
2. The model learns an approximately *Bayes Optimal algorithm*
3. The existence of double descent proves linear regression. https://youtu.be/DiJsg93zQDc?t=2953
