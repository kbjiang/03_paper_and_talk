## Main takeaways

## What I don't agree

## Questions

1. talk: https://youtu.be/DiJsg93zQDc
2. paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01066.pdf
3. take away from talk:
	1. Transformer architecture learns simple functions like linear, tree etc in a in-context fashion quite efficiently.
		1. E.g., it learns about linear functions as well as linear regressors trained , even though no linearity is presumed!
	2. Not really sure: In-context? How does it generalize to other functions?
