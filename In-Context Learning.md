### In-Context Learning: A Case Study of Simple Function Classes
1. talk: https://youtu.be/DiJsg93zQDc
2. take away:
	1. Transformer architecture learns simple functions like linear, tree etc in a in-context fashion quite efficiently.
		1. E.g., it learns about linear functions as well as linear regressors trained , even though no linearity is presumed!
	2. Not really sure: In-context? How does it generalize to other functions?
